Hi, my name is Mayer

I'm a data scientist, public health informaticist, and computer scientist fascinated by how technology solves real-world problems—especially applied AI in public health and production ML systems.

* 🔭 I'm currently a Data Scientist at the CDC, helping public health professionals upskill and implement AI/ML solutions. My work spans predictive modeling, NLP, patient matching algorithms, big data analytics, data visualization and generative AI systems.

* 🔨 I build tools, proof of concepts, and tutorials that modernize health systems. Check out [duplicategenerator](https://github.com/mayerantoine/duplicategenerator), [cdc-text-corpora](https://github.com/mayerantoine/cdc-text-corpora), [injury narrative coding](https://github.com/mayerantoine/injury-narrative-coding-transformers), and [patient matching](https://github.com/mayerantoine/matching-comparative-review).

* 📚 I advance AI/ML capabilities across CDC through technical consultation, problem-solving, and creating learning materials that bridge research and real-world application.

* 🎓 Graduate of the Public Health Informatics Fellowship Program (PHIFP) and Georgia Tech's MS in Computer Science.

* 💡 I love projects at the intersection of AI research and healthcare impact.

I'm best reached via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mayerantoine/). Always open to conversations about AI in healthcare, public health informatics, or interesting technical challenges. 🤝

Below is a list of technologies (mostly open-source frameworks, libraries, and languages) I regularly use and enjoy working with. If you want to see more of what I do or have done, check out my [GitHub](https://github.com/mayerantoine).
